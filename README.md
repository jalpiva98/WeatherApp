# WeatherApp
The Weather Dashboard App is a web application that allows users to retrieve and display the current weather and the next four days' weather forecast for a specific city. It uses the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data based on user input.

## How to Use
Enter a City: In the left sidebar, there is an input field where you can type the name of the city for which you want to retrieve the weather information.

Get Weather: Click the "Get Weather" button to fetch and display the current weather and forecast for the specified city.

Weather Display: The weather information for the selected city will be displayed on the right side of the app. It will show the current weather details, including temperature, description, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representing the weather condition. Additionally, the app will show the forecast for the next four days, including the day of the week, temperature, description, and weather icon.

Search History: The app keeps track of the last five searched cities in the left sidebar. Clicking on any of the previous search items will fetch the weather data for that city again.
